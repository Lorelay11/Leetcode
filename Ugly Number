Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
Example 3:

Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note:

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].

class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int num) {
        if(num<1){
            return false;
        }
        //if number can be divided by 2 divide it by 2
        while(num%2==0){
            num/=2;
            System.out.println("2: "+num);
        }
        //if number can be divided by 3 divide it by 3
        while(num%3==0){
            num/=3;
            System.out.println("3: "+num);
        }
        //if number can be divided by 5 divide it by 5
        while(num%5==0){
            num/=5;
            System.out.println("5: "+num);
        }
        //if at the end we have 1 than number is ugly as it was divided by only prime numbers 2,3,5
        return num==1;
    }

}
